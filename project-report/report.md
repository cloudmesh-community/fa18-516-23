In [@vonLaszwski-fa18-sample-report] we can find a sample report.

+@fig:fromonetotheorther shows a nice figure exported from Powerpoint
to png. If you like you can use this as a basis for your drawings.

![A simple flow chart](images/from-one-to-the-other.png){#fig:fromonetotheorther}

Figures must not be cited with an explicit number, but automated
numbering must be used. Here is how we did it for this paper:

```
+@fig:fromonetotheorther shows a nice
figure exported from Powerpoint to png.
If you like you can use this as a basis
for your drawings.

![A simple flow chart](images/from-one-to-the-other.png){#fig:fromonetotheorther}
```

If the figure is copied form another source you MUST use a citation in the caption. 

![A simple flow chart [@vonLaszwski-fa18-sample-report]](images/from-one-to-the-other.png){#fig:fromonetotheorther}

This is done as follows

```

```
